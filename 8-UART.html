    <h1>Communication Protocols</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Parallel</h2>
      <p>
        Parallel connection means that we will send all the bits at once each on
        a single wire and there are some Advantages and disadvantages for this
        kind of communication so lets discuss them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Advantage</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Highest speed</b>: that is because we send a big number of bits
            at the same time
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>DisAdvantages</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Complex Connection</b>: we need alot of DI/O pins which will be
            wasted to connect two micro controllers together like if we are
            transfering 8-bits register we need to reserve 8 pins on each micro
            controller to achieve transfering the values in this register.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Noise</b>: Each wire will create a mangetic field around it and
            this may cause noise and change a value in a wire by accident.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Timer-Scew</b>: This means that not all the charges reach its
            destination at the same time as we discussed in the LCD for example
            where we need to wait for all the pulses to reach its destination
            first and then give a pulse for them to enter the register to make
            sure they sll enter at once.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <h3>Usage</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Parallel connection Mainly used Inside the pereferalls registers
          interfacing with micocontroller.
        </li>
        <li>
          Also as a Special case parallel connection is used by HD-cameras and
          was patent for STM32 micro controller owners, and this came from the
          need of transferring millions of bits at the same time released by the
          camera.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Serial Communication</h2>
      <p>
        So now that we have introduced the parallel connection let us detail
        different Types of Serial connections. <br />
        Serial communication in general means that we are transfering each bit
        in one clock-pulse.
      </p>
      <h3>Types of Serial Communications</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Wired/Wireless</li>
        <li>Sender/Reciever Based</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Simplex</b>: where each micro controller is fixed to one role
            either as a sender or a reciever this means that one of them will
            always be the sender and the other is always going to be the
            Reciever.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Half-Duplex</b>: Where when a micocontroller is sending the other
            will act as a reciever and vice-versa. This means that both can now
            work as a sender and a reciever but not in the same time
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Full-Duplex</b>: Where both can work as senders and recievers at
            the same time
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>synchronization</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Synchronous</b>: This means that between each micocontroller a
            shared CLK, so imagine having a controller with a crystal of 8MHz
            and another controller with 16MHz and we need to send data between
            both, therfore we will connect a shared CLK wire with a prescaler to
            allow both send and recieve all the data. such as SPI and I2C <br />
            Also we Got LIN which is a more complex type of Synchronous and we
            will discuss it in details when we get into the automotive bus tech
            but for now it doesn't share a clock and yet considered synchornous
            type.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Asynchronous</b>: No Shared clock yet we can set the Frequency of
            this pereferal manually on both sides. so let us say that we will
            set manually the UART Pereferal using a prescalar on both micro
            Controllers to 10KHz this means that we will send 10Kbits/sec and
            this is called <b>Bit-Rate</b> <br />
            yet there is another unit we do use in the industry yother than the
            bit rate and it is called <b>Baud-Rate</b> <br />
            <b>Baud-Rate</b>: is Symbol/sec and the symbol is dependent on
            different standards where symbol in manchester is 3 bits for example
            and the Baud-Rate is 10KSymbol/sec this means 30KBit/sec.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Connection Types</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Peer To Peer</b>: Communication between two Micro Controllers
            where both can intiate sending or recieving the data between them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Single Master Multi Slave</b>: This is what defines a master
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Intiator</b> to Sending and recieving the data from the slaves
            </li>
            <li>defines <b>CLK</b> for all its slaves</li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            <b>Multi Master Multi Slaves</b> and we will discuss this later in
            I2C and CAN.

          Bluetooth Module for example works using UART communication Protocol.
        </li>

        <li>The Two pins used are T<sub>x</sub> and R<sub>x</sub></li>
        <li>
          The UART Can work as Synchronous its just an extra option available in
          UART
        </li>
        <li>UART is a tech developed on a standard of RS232 or RS485</li>

      <h3>USB TTL Module</h3>
      <p>
        The Computers voltage range is for logic 1 is rom -3V to -25V and Logic
        0 form 3V to 25V while micocontroller Logic1 is 5V and Logic0 is 0V and
        this indicates the Big Voltage difference level between both and
        therfore we needed to convert this voltage to transistor level so they
        can interface together so inside the USB TTL Module a Microchip called
        MAX232 Convertor which changes the USB Voltage Level to
        <b>Transistor to Transistor Level</b> and there comes the Name of TTL

      <h2>UART Pereferal</h2>
      <p>
        There are two main things to be defined for any communication Protocol
        First thing is the Frame and secondly the Hardware so let us define the
        UART Frame.
      </p>
      <h3>UART Frame</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Start Bit</b>: which signifies the beginning of the data
          Transmitted and its normally a 0 bit
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Data Bits</b>: They need to be between 5-9 bits and they are the
          Data transmitted itself in our case we will transmit 8 bits.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Stopping Bit</b>: They can be defined as a sing High or double High
          and they are different modes that achieve the same signal to notify
          the ending of the data transmitted or recieved.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Parity Bit</b>: It is one of the simplist error controlling methods
          where it identifies either the data Even or odd and if so it send a
          single bit to make the data transmitted is always even or odd so it
          will either add one to the data bits or a zero to assure the recciever
          catches an even data and therfore we can identify if there was any
          issing data due to noise or any other factors.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>UART Hardware</h3>
      <p>
        The UART uses a <b>Parsing Method</b> where it samples each bit being
        sent from 8:16 times to make sure that the pulse it either High or a
        low. <br />
        Now let us talk about a new form of prescalar and its mechanism: <br />
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="Pics/Pre-Scaler-UART.JPG" alt="PreScalar2" />
        <ol>
          <li>So we put a value in the UBRR let us assume we pu a 9</li>
          <li>
            There is a counter as demonstrated on the img upwards and this
            counter counts down till reaching a zero then a flag is raised also
            it counts with the same speed of the Occilator.
          </li>
          <li>
            So the Total counts are 9(UBRR) and 1 for the flag so a total of 10
            counts
          </li>
          <li>
            so if we wanna know the amount of pulses transmitted now will be
            (f<sub>occilator</sub>/(UBRR+1))
          </li>
          <li>
            Not lets fllow up with the Block diagram upwards so
            (f<sub>occilator</sub>/2(UBRR+1))
          </li>
          <li>
            Again lets fllow up with the Block diagram upwards so
            (f<sub>occilator</sub>/8(UBRR+1))
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally either you want this amount of pulse so let it got to the
            multiplixer or devide it one more time and let the ourput be
            (f<sub>occilator</sub>/16(UBRR+1))
          </li>
        </ol>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Let me say that <b>Baud-Rate = (f<sub>occilator</sub>/16(UBRR+1))</b>,
        where each device-Module needs a determained Baud-Rate to interface with
        it and is determined in its data-sheet. <br />
        for example Bluetooth-HC05- Baud-Rate is 9600 and Blutooth-HC06
        Baud-Rate is 115,200 can't we calculate the UBRR for each one of them!!
