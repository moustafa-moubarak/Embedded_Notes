    <h1>Pulse Width Modulation</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Fast PWM</h2>
      <p>
        We Did cover the Fast PWM method in Timers-part2-, where we said that we
        do have two modes the Normal and inverted so let us put this in the form
        of equations.
      </p>
      <h3>Non-Inverted Mode Fast-PWM</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Duty-Cycle = (OCR + 1)/256</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Inverted Mode Fast-PWM</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Duty-Cycle = (255 - OCR)/256</li>
      </ul>
      <aside>
        <p>
          Remember that The Duty Cycle is the ration of <b>ON Cyles</b> to the
          <b>Total Cycles</b>. Yet there is a major draw-Back in those two modes
          where we can't achieve a full 100% and 0% on the same mode, yet the
          Major Advantage is that it achieves The highest frequency possible.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Duty-Cycle<sub>non-Inverted</sub> = (0 + 1)/256
            <ul>
              <li>So It can't achieve a 0% there will always be fractions</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Duty-Cycle<sub>Inverted</sub> = (255 - 0)/256
            <ul>
              <li>So It can't achieve a 100%</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This demonstrations means that we can achieve only one either 100% or
          0% on the same Pin
        </p>
        <p>Now Lets look into the Frequency of the wave Generated Equation</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            f<sub>Generated Wave</sub> = (f<sub>Occilator</sub> = ((PreScalar) x
            Top) +1)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As the Frequency of Occilator increases the frequency of Generated
          wave increases just put this in mind till explaining the
          Phase-Correct.
        </p>

      <h2>Phase-Correct</h2>
      <p>
        So here is the difference in the wave where the counter TCNT start
        counting up till reaching the Top and then starts to count back down,
        such that the cycle will be doubled. now imagine puting a value in the
        OCR of 100 How many times will the OCR cut the Wave?? <br />
        Yes you are right, it will intesect two times one while the counter is
        going up and once while going down. <br />
        So the Lets assume that the wave is starting with a high pulse and when
        reaching OCR value will turn low then will start counting down and will
        intersect the OCR value again so will turn up high again and continue
        till the TCNT reaches a zero. Yet one draw-back here is that the
        frequency is halfed cuz the time taken to make one wave is doubled.
        <br />
        so if you are wondering why we need this mode, ofc it's to simply deal
        with the problem of the Zero and full load, let us demonstrate how
        through the equations.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Duty-Cycle = (2 x OCR)/(2 x Top) = (OCR)/(Top)
          <ul>
            <li>
              We can Now put either a Zero or the Top value inside the OCR and a
              0% or 100% can eaisly be implemented. <br />
              This can assure that Accuracy of the Phase-Correct Mode.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          f<sub>Generated Wave</sub> = (f<sub>Occilator</sub> / ((PreScalar) x
          Top))
        </li>
        <p>f<sub>Generated Wave</sub> is halfed because the Top is doubled</p>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So lets generalize the concept, where if we wanna achieve the highest
        Frequency(speed for example) we need to use the <b>Fast PWM</b> while if
        we need a high Accuracy from the wave we will use <b>Phase-Correct</b>.

      <h2>DC-Motor Driver</h2>
      <h3>H-Bridge</h3>
      <p>
        Okay let's now talk about a new component that will help us control the
        DC-Motor and its called <b>H-Bridge</b>.
        <figure>
          <img src="Pics/H-Bridge-IC.JPG" alt="H-Bridge_IC" />
        </figure>
        Lets discuss the List of pins available on this PCB of H-Brdige I do
        have currently and whithin we will understand the mechanism of each pin.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The lower volt and grnd are the ones powering the IC.</li>
        <li>
          The Volt and ground on top are the ones powering the Motor, of which
          the IC will control.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then we have EnableA which we connect to the Pin getting the output
          from ATMEGA32 and we will work on Timer0 so it will be connected to
          OC0(PB3).
        </li>
        <li>
          Then we have pin1 Pin2 and those control the direction of the motor
          where whenever pin1 gets a High pulse and Pin2 gets a Low the motor
          moves Clockwise and vise-versa.
        </li>
        <li>EnableB, Pin3 and Pin4 are the same as EnableA, Pin1 and Pin2</li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
        <p>Now let me demonstrate the Simple H-Bridge Circuit</p>
        <img src="Pics/H-Bridge-Circuit.JPG" alt="Circuit_H" />
      </figure>
      <p>
        I believe Now we can code our H-Bridge IC to control the Direction of
        the motor

      <h2>Servo-Motor</h2>
      <p>
        A Servo-Motor is a motor that moves with defined angles and for it to
        work it contains a programmable IC which will discuss in details in this
        section.
      </p>
      <h4>
        The Frequency needed For the Servo-Motor is 50Hz so how can we generate
        a wave from the PWM that matches 50Hz!!!
      </h4>
      <p>
        let me remind You with the Frequency of generated wave equation first in
        PWM which we concluded upwards.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          f<sub>Generated Wave</sub> = (f<sub>Occilator</sub> / ((PreScalar) x
          Top))
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Knowing That:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>f<sub>Occilator</sub>: based on our crystal is 16,000,000 Hz</li>
        <li>PreScalar: Lets use the Highest which is 1024</li>
        <li>Top: If we are using Fast-PWM 256</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        &there4; f<sub>Generated Wave</sub> = 61 Hz <br />
        So whatever Duty-Cycle is sent, would be an invalid input to the IC of
        the Servo so we need to lower it more and the only variable we can
        control now, after maximizing the Prescalar, is the <b>TOP</b> so let me
        introduce you to a new register called <b>ICR</b> and this is a register
        that we can store in the Top value needed to generate the desired
        frequency as needed. <br />
        <b
          >Yet Remember that the Register OCR is still of usage where we store
          in it the value of the Duty-Cycle Desired.
        </b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Duty-Cycle = (OCR + 1)/256</li>
      </ul>
