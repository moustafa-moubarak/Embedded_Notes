      <h2>Where should we include INT-ISR?!?</h2>
      <p>
        We wrote the OVF-ISR in part-1 in the app layer, but was that the best
        code design ?!? <br />
        Definetly its a big fat NO, let me demonstrate why... <br />
        We Got many ISRs along our code that is related to different pereferals
        of the Micro-Controller, so now at least we know that we need to include
        it in the MCAL because its pereferal related, yet here is the problem.
        When we wrote our OVF-ISR we used some functions from LED.h (HAL) so the
        first rule of a well designed code is not to use an upper layer inside a
        lower one.
      </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Application</li>
          <li>HAL</li>
          <li>MCAL</li>
        </ol>
      </aside>
      <p>
        Okay so now lets see how we can solve such a problem... <br />
        let me Introduce you to a new software Technique<b
          ><em>Call Back Function</em></b
        >, and this will take an input of a pointer to function. <br />
        Lets Implement this in code and then we will trace it back to understand
        what happened.
      </p>
      <h3>Lets update Code Timer.c</h3>
      <pre>
          <code>

            #include &#60;avr/interrupt.h>

            void (* Ptr) (void);

            void Set_CallBack(void(*p)(void))
            {
                Ptr = p;
            }
            
            ISR(TIMER0_OVF_vect)
            {
                static uint32 cnt = 0;
                
                cnt++;
                
                if(cnt == NUM_OVF)
                {
                    cnt = 0;
                    (*Ptr)();
                    TCNT0 - INIT_VALUE;
                }
            }
          </code>
      </pre>
      <h3>Lets Udate the main.c</h3>
      <pre>
          <code>
            #include "Timer.h"
            #include "LED_HAL.h"
            
            
            extern uint32	NUM_OVF	;
            extern uint8	INIT_VALUE;
            
            int main(void)
            {
                LED0_Init();
                Timer0_Init();
                Set_CallBack(LED0_Toggle);
                Timer0_SetDelay(2000); 
                Timer0_Start();
                while (1) 
                {
                }
            }            
          </code>
      </pre>
      <h3>Okay Lets Trace our application...</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>We Intialized LED0 and Timer0</li>
        <li>
          Then we Used our new function called Set_CallBack and Its input was
          the function name of LED0_Toggle from LED.h.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lets go to Set_CallBack Source file which is Timer.c
          <ol>
            <li>
              we can see that Set_CallBack takes an input of pointer to function
              and we passed in it LED0_Toggle meaning that Set_CallBack now got
              the address of LED0_Toggle.
            </li>
            <li>
              Yet this Address is only seen in that function therfore we needed
              to assign it to a global pointer, therfore we defined a global
              pointer to function called Ptr and assigned in it The pointer *p.
            </li>
            <li>
              Now all the functions in timer can see the address of the function
              LED0_Toggle inside the pointer-to-function *Ptr
            </li>
            <li>
              Now lets see the ISR where it will excute exactly as before except
              for instead of excuting the LED0_Toggle, we will change that line
              to excute whatever function inside *Ptr that why we can see <br />
              <em>(*Ptr)()</em>.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        So Now we can conclude that we made everything more generaic and a very
        well designed code where each ISR will be included to the Driver using
        it from now on.

      <h2>CTC-Clear Timer on Compare match-</h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="Pics/Timer0_Internal_Circuit.JPG" alt="T0_IC" />
        <p>
          If we Look at T0-Internal-Circuit we can find realize that there are
          two registers one of them we have already used in our code which is
          TCNT0 which was the main counter of Timer0 but here is the new
          register we wanna introduce which is <b>OCR0</b> or
          <em>Output Compare Match Register</em> and they are both connected to
          a Comparator. <br />
          So here is the deal with the CTC we will write the number of ticks we
          wanna achieve in OCR0 and the TCNT0 will count just like before but
          the difference, that whenever the TCNT0 reaches the count inside the
          OCR0 the Comparator will detect that they are the same and the
          <em>Output Compare Flag </em>"<b>OCF</b>" will be raised and will fire
          the ISR of the Output-compare-match (ISR(Timer-OC)) <br />
          Let us work on CTC-Mode on Timer1 to understand the different Timers.
        </p>
      </figure>
      <h3>Timer1</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="Pics/Timer1.JPG" alt="Timer1_Circuit" />
        <p>
          ATMEGA32 gave us the opportunity to work on Timer1 with capacity
          registers of 16-bit where we are gonna combine using the software two
          8-bit registers as we did before with a high and low registers. and
          actually ATMEGA32 gave us various modes to work on Timer1 such as the
          Normal-mode we emplemented on Timer0 and one of the modes is the CTC
          aswell now lets go check the Different modes.
        </p>
        <img src="Pics/Timer1_DiffModes.JPG" alt="Timer1DifferentModes" />
        <p>
          As we can see that the CTC(mode-4) is wokring at a top of OCR1A which
          means that this is the Register that we will use for the compare match
          with the TCNT1.
        </p>

      <h2>PWM-Pulse Width Modulation-</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Let's say we wanna control a DC-Motor with a speed of 50%(Half-Loaded),
        therfore we are going to minipulate the pulse entering this motor to be
        50% high and 50% Low. <br />
        This means that we want (Total Wave On)/(Top_Value) needs to be equal
        50%. <br />
        &there4; Duty-Cycle = (Total_Wave_On/Top_Value)*100. <br />
        One of the Things that can minipulate the Duty-Cycle is the PWM, which
        is one of the modes inside the Timers.
      </p>
      <h3>Mechanism of working(Fast_PWM)</h3>
      <p>
        Okay so now we know that we do have a Register called TCNT which is
        responsible for counting inside the Timer, and when it reaches the
        maximum count the OVF is raised and we also Introduced the OCR where we
        can intiate inside a Time to compare with TCNT and if equal the OCF is
        raised. so we can generalize the Cycle of the Timer to two stages one
        where the OCR limit is reached and the second is where the OVF happens.
        <br />
        okay now we will consider the full pulse is = 255 (Full Cycle in TCTNT)
        <br />
        and we will say that we want the value store inside the OCR = 100.
        <br />
        Here is whats going to happen, the wave is normally high and the TCNT
        started counting till reaching the value 100 then the OCF is raised so
        the Pulse will be inverted to low, and the TCNT will continue on
        counting till reaching 255, then the OVF is raised signifing the end of
        a full pulse and the cycle is inverted again to High and the process
        goes on. <br />
        &there4; in this case Duty-Cycle = (100/255)*100 = 39% <br />
        This means that only 39% of the wave of one pulse will be High and in
        other words the DC-Motor will be loaded with 39%. <br />
        This is called The Non-Inverted-Mode where the Pulse is normally High
        yet we have the inverted mode where the Pulse is normally low. <br />
        One Important Factor in what we just explained is the Frequency of wave
        Generated, how much time will the pulse take to be repeated <br />
        &becaus; f<sub>Timer</sub> = (f<sub>oscillator</sub>)/(Prescalar) <br />
        &becaus; f<sub>Generated_Wave</sub> = (f<sub>Timer</sub>)/(Top) <br />
        &there4; f<sub>Generated_Wave</sub> =
        (f<sub>oscillator</sub>)/(Prescalar*Top) <br />
