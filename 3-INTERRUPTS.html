          First thing is first We need to dicuss an important concept called
          System faults.
        </p>
        <h3>What causes System Faults/Exceptions !?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Bus Fault</li>
          <li>Memory Faults</li>
          <li>Dividing by Zero</li>
          <li>Reset</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Secondly there are Pereferal Exceptions that becomes priority for the
          CPU to excute these are called <b>INTERRUPTS</b>. <br />
          For every Interrupt we need to define its handeler which is the
          way(code) to handle the Interrupt this code is called
          <b>Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)</b>.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Now you must be wondering what is Difference between a normal function
          and an ISR!?
        </h3>
        <p>
          A normal function excutes within the code at a certain time but an ISR
          runs wherever the code reached, it always takes the priority whenever
          an interrupt condition happens.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Now lets ask a question, considering an inntrupt excutted and the ISR
          ran, will the code start running from the beginning again?!?!
        </h3>
        <p>
          The answer is ofcourse not, this would be a total waste of time but
          the real question here is <b>HOW??</b> <br />
