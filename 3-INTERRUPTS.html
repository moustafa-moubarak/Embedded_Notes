        <p>
          First thing is first We need to dicuss an important concept called
          System faults.
        </p>
        <h3>What causes System Faults/Exceptions !?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Bus Fault</li>
          <li>Memory Faults</li>
          <li>Dividing by Zero</li>
          <li>Reset</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Secondly there are Pereferal Exceptions that becomes priority for the
          CPU to excute these are called <b>INTERRUPTS</b>. <br />
          For every Interrupt we need to define its handeler which is the
          way(code) to handle the Interrupt this code is called
          <b>Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)</b>.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Now you must be wondering what is Difference between a normal function
          and an ISR!?
        </h3>
        <p>
          A normal function excutes within the code at a certain time but an ISR
          runs wherever the code reached, it always takes the priority whenever
          an interrupt condition happens. <br />
          we Can make any code in a serial process by using _ms_delay this
          serial process is called blocking/polling yet the interrupt is a
          parallel process and the controller is signal through the hardware.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Now lets ask a question, considering an inntrupt excutted and the ISR
          ran, will the code start running from the beginning again?!?!
        </h3>
        <p>
          The answer is ofcourse not, this would be a total waste of time but
          the real question here is <b>HOW??</b> <br />
        </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>R0, R1 ,R2:</b>They are the CPU
              <em>General Purpose Registers.</em> that holds the variables.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>PC:</b>Is a general purpose registers
              <em>Program Counter</em> which saves the upcoming instruction to
              be excuted.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>SP:</b>Called the <em>Stack Pointer</em> One of its main
              functions is to point on the last address of the stack memory in
              RAM.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>ALU:</b>
              <em>arithmetic logic unit.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </aside>
        <p>
          Lets imagine that we want to take a capture for the CPU where its
          excuting an imaginary function called ADD() and all the general
          purpose registers are full of values and addresses and an interrupt
          command just came to the CPU telling it to leave everything and to
          excute the ISR so where will these values go, how will it handle the
          <b>parallel process</b> we were talking about??
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            It will <b>PUSH</b>/Save the
            <b>Context</b>/values-inside-the-registers inside the frame of the
            function Add(), scuh that when the ISR finishes excution, the CPU
            would understand the place it should continue from again.
          </li>
          <li>
            The ISR code of the relevant interrupt will be inserted in the RAM
            Stack to be excuted and after its done it will be removed from the
            stack yet we didn't know where did the ISR came from, so lets hold
            on to this point and we will discuss it later.
          </li>
          <li>Now the CPU will <b>POP</b> the context out.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          These Steps details the idea of a process called
          <b>CONTEXT SWITCHING</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Interrupt sevice routines are normal functions saved in the ROM
          text partition with all the other functions yet their addresses are
          saved inside something called a <b>Vector-Table</b>, such that when an
          ISR is called inside the main function the CPU would understand which
          address to call the ISR text commands.
        </p>
        <aside>
          <p>
            <b>Note:</b> The Contexts of Interrupts are saved inside the RAM
            while the action itself excutes inside the ROM this process is
            called Jumping on machine level.
          </p>
        </aside>
        <p>
          There is a hardware component that is called
          <b><em>Programmable Interrupt Controller</em></b
          >, Its main job is to point out the addresses of the interrupts from
          the <b>Vector Table</b>. <br />
          One Other Job for the <em>PIC</em> is to manage the Priority of the
          Interrupts in case Many Interrupts happened at the same time, and it
          manages it by the order of it inside the Vector table. And we can't
          change the priorities in case of ATMEGA32, yet inside the ARM
          Architecture the NVEC (Nested vector interrupt control), which is the
          PIC inside the ARM architecture, we can controll the priorities
          Through Nesting the Interrupts.

        </figure>
        <p>To Enable the <em>PIC</em> It needs Three signals:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>GIE:</b>General Interrupt Enable</li>
          <li><b>PIE:</b>Pereferal Interrupt Enable</li>

            An Improtant Matter we need to point out is the Timing of everything
            since the whole prcess is parallel.

        <h2>Lets CODE!!</h2>
      </header>
      <main>
        <p>
          Let us Define the Registers of External Interrupts and add them to
          <b><em>MCU.h</em></b> we created before.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            /****************** EXT INT REG ******************/

            #define		SREG		*((volatile uint8*) 0x5F)
            #define		MCUCR		*((volatile uint8*) 0x55)
            #define		MCUSR		*((volatile uint8*) 0x54)
            #define		GICR		*((volatile uint8*) 0x5B)
            #define		GIFR		*((volatile uint8*) 0x5A)
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Now lets define the External interrupt configuration file and detail
          everything written in this file after<b><em>EXT_INT_Config.h</em></b
          ><br />
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            #define		GLOBAL_INTERRUPT				GLOBAL_INTERRUPT_ENABLE

            #define		EXTERNAL_INT0_TRIGGER			TRIGGER_RISING
            #define		EXTERNAL_INT1_TRIGGER			TRIGGER_RISING
            #define		EXTERNAL_INT2_TRIGGER			TRIGGER_RISING
          </code>
        </pre>
        <ul>
          <li>
            As mentioned before we need to enable the External Interrupt using
            three steps:
            <ul>
              <li>Enable General Interrupt</li>
              <li>Enable Pereferal Interrupt</li>
              <li>Enable Flag</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>So we enabled the Global Interrupt (General Interrupt)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Then we need to determine the trigger of the interrupt which means
          when will the interrupt start firing or at which signal exactly there
          are four main treiggers to any interrupt which are the defined phases
          of any signal.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Signal Rising</b></li>
          <li><b>Signal Falling</b></li>
          <li><b>Signal Low</b></li>
          <li><b>After any Logical change</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          That is the main Idea of the macros we are gonna create now in
          <b><em>EXT_INT.h</em></b> File. <br />
          so LETS CODE <em>EXT_INT.h</em>!!!!

          Let's talk about the recall functions we created and discuss what they

            <b>void Set_GlobalInterrupt(void)</b>: This is a function to

            enabled and if set to <b>0</b> then the Global Interrupt will be
            disabled.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>void External_INT#_Init (void)</b>: is to enable the Flag and

            <li>
              INT0 & INT1 are exactly the same where the register controlling
              the Triggeres of it is the <b>MCUCR</b> and the exact bits for
              each of them is demonstrated inside the data sheet, while the
              register controlling the Flag is <b>GICR</b> and still the bit is
              defined in the data sheet depending on the number of interrupt
              (INT1,INT0)
            </li>
            <li>
              INT2 triggers are controlled using <b>MCUSR</b> and the flag using
