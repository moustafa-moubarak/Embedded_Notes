    <h1>Timers</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <h3>What is a Timer !!</h3>
      <p>
        Timer is a pereferal Like any other pereferal that counts and calculates
        time without the an interfering with the CPU. <br />
        We did use before in our code function <em>_delay_ms</em>, what this
        function does is that the code enters an empty loop which the CPU
        excutes and gets the CPU stuck at that line of code till the number of
        seconds ends. <br />
        Timers work in a a very different concept where when ever it releases
        the order to count some time the CPU wont be notified this time the CPU
        will keep on moving forward with the code and whenever the timer
        finishes counting it notifies the CPU using an interrupt and the ISR
        (Interrupt Service Routine) starts working after the counting is
        finished. <br />
        This part is life changing concept where we can fire everything whenever
        we want. Put in mind that any event around us is either time based or
        Event based, either they work in a parallel process or in a series
        process and by timers we can achieve the parallel process easily and
        smoothly without affecting our CPU performance.
      </p>
      <h3>Mechanism of working</h3>
      <p>
        Timers from inside got a basic counter and a flag if we are considering
        Timer0 inside ATMEGA32 it contains an 8-bit register that counts from 0
        to 255 and whenever it finishes counting an <b>Overflow Flag</b> is
        raised and this takes one more count to be raised, so the total counts
        are 256 and then it overflows starts again from the beginning. <br />

        The time taken for each count is called <b>Tick Time</b>,so let me ask a
        question here, How much would it take to count 256 Tick?? <br />
        &because; Crytal Frequency we are using = 16 million Hz <br />
        &there4; one Tick Time = one Instruction = 1/16M = 0.06&micro;s <br />
        &there4; 256 Tick Time = 256 * 1/16M = 16&micro;s <br />

        Therfore This means that it take 16&micro;s to make 1 Full Cycle
        including the Raise of the Timer Flag. <br />

        Now Let me ask you how to achieve a 1ms if the whole cycle takes only
        16&micro;s?? <br />
        Its by simply slowing down the Tick-Time and this can be achieved by
        slowing the down the the Clock frequency and yes, as you guessed it we
        will use a <b>prescalar</b> .
        <figure>
          <img src="Pics/Pre-Scaler1.JPG" alt="Pre-Scaler1" />
        </figure>
        &there4; Tick-Time = (prescalar)/(Crystal Frequency) <br />
        &there4; Overflow-Time = 256*Tick Time <br />
        I agree with you this did reduce the Time yes but still its defined and
        not that flexible, thefore there are many modes we can work on one of
        them is the basic mode or what we call <b>Timers Normal Mode</b>.
      </p>
      <h3>Timers Normal Mode</h3>
      <p>
        The Normal Mode is based on ending with the number 256 because this is
        where the flag will be raised. but we never mentioned that we have to
        start from Zero so lets give an example to know how to calculate the
        starting point of counting. <br />
        let us say we want to Achieve 1ms and Crystal is 16 Million Hz <br />
        &because; Tick-Time = (prescalar)/(Crystal Frequency) = 256/16M = 16
        &micro;s <br />
        &Therefore; Number of ticks we need to achieve 1 ms = 1000/16 = 62 ticks
        <br />
        &there4; Intial Value to start counting to achieve 1 ms = 256 - 62 = 194
        <br />

        This means That we need to start counting from tick 194 as an intial
        value to achieve 1 ms in Normal Mode. <br />

        Now lets discuss another example where we wanna achieve a 100 ms while
        the Prescalar limit is 1024 <br />

        &because; Tick-Time = (prescalar)/(Crystal Frequency) = 1024/16M = 64
        &micro;s <br />
        &there4; we need to know how many overflows we need to achieve that 100
        ms <br />
        &there4; num-ovf = 100/16 = 6.25 rotations <br />
        &there4; we need to know where to start to achieve the 0.25 of the
        overflow and then add it to 6 overflows <br />
        &there4; 0.25*256 = 64 tick <br />
        &there4; Intial Value to start counting to achieve 0.25 of the overflow
        = 192 <br />

      <h2>Lets CODE!!!</h2>
      <p>
        First thing is First we need to know which layer where we are going to
        write our code. Timers-Drivers are in the MCAL yet as we dicussed before
        we are going to use overflow interrupt to raise the flag of conversion,
        and therfore as per our understanding to external interrupts the
        Timer-ISR will be written in the main code (Just for now we will discuss
        this in the next section). So lets get to work...
      </p>
      <h3>Update <em>MCU.h</em> to add Timers Registers</h3>
      <h4>
        Check "8-bit Timer/Counter Registers Description" Section in DataSheet
      </h4>
      <pre>
          <code>
            #define		TCCR0		(*(volatile uint8*)(0x53))

            #define		TIFR		(*(volatile uint8*)(0x58))
          </code>
      </pre>

      <h3>Create <em>Timer0_Config.h</em> To make our Driver more generaic</h3>
      <pre>
          <code>
            #define		WAVEFORM_GEN_Mode		Normal

            #define		OVF_Ticks				256
          </code>
      </pre>
      <p>So lets detail each Macro...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To begin with The Wave Generation mode is where we select the mode we
          are going to work on as we defined we are gonna work with the
          Normal-Mode only for now but will define all the modes in our code for
          now and in the upcoming sections we will discuss them in details.
        </li>
        <li>
          Selection of Timer0_Prescalar as we explained before the importance of
          it and it working mechanism.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finaly the PRESCALER_FACTOR and OVF_TICKS are gonna be used as
          variables in our code.
        </li>
