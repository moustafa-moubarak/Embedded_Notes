    <h1>Serial Perepheral Interface -SPI-</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>SPI Specs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Wired</li>
        <li>Serial</li>
        <li>Full Duplex</li>
        <li>Synchronous</li>
        <li>Single Master Multi Slaves</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>SPI Pins</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>MOSI</b>: Master Output Slave Input</li>
        <li><b>MISO</b>: Master Input Slave Output</li>
        <li><b>CLK</b>: Share Clock Pin</li>
        <li><b>SS/CS</b>: Selected Slave/Chip Select</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Basic mechanism Process</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          First thing is the selection where the master chooses the Slave its
          gonna communicate with, through the <b>SS-pin</b> and this happens
          through sending a 0 pulse to the slave which is translated by the
          Slave hardware that its currently selected as a readiness sign.
        </li>
        <li>
          Second step is sending the CLK from the Master to the slave such that
          the slave would understand the speed of communication its gonna send
          and recieve with.(Synchronous)
        </li>
        <li>
          Now lets discuss the MISO/MOSO Process, We will begin our capture
          where the Master got a stored value and the slave got a value
        </li>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The Master send 1-bit and instaneously the slave sends 1-bit and
            thats why its called <b>Exchange-Process</b>, where both happens at
            the same time.
          </li>
          <li>
            At the same insident the Master and slave shifts Right by one bit,
            and that is why those two registers are called <b>Shift REGs</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            All that happens dueto one Pulse from the CLK, and therfore we can
            conclude that the Full registers will exchange their values in
            8-CLK-Pulses.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
      <h2>SS/CS Connection Types</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Normal Connection</li>
        <li>Daisy Chain</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Normal Connection</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="Pics/SPI_Normal_Connection.png" alt="SPI_NC" />
      </figure>
      <p>
        So as we said previously that the SS Pin needs to signify a zero bit to
        the Selected Slave so can't we replace that 0 bit with any DIO-Pin to
        send the zero to Multiple slaves!! and thats the fastest connection as
        we discussed where all is needed one 8 pulses to transfere the data.
      </p>
      <h3>Daisy Chain</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="Pics/SPI_Daisy-Chain.png" alt="SPI_DC" />
      </figure>
      <p>
        However What about if we have 10/20/30 slaves The master wanna
        communicate with!! <br />
        So its decided to make another type of connection called daisy chain
        where the master communicates with first slave and each slave
        communicates with other slaves and therfore if the we need S1-Data it
        will need to pass through S2 the S3 and finally till it reaches the
        Master.
      </p>
      <h4>Advantage Daisy-Chain</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Cures the limitation of DIO-Pins</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Disadvantage Daisy-Chain</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Way Slower Than the Direct/Normal Connection</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Clock Cycle Dive Deeper</h2>
      <p>
        There are two main factors in the CLK <b>Clock Polarity</b> and
        <b>Clock Phase</b>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>CLK Polarity</b>: This indicates the intial logic either a zero or
          a one.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>CLK Phase</b>: This indicates the reading and writing on one pulse,
          If CLK_PH = 0 this means that the <b>sample Reading</b> is in
          <b>Leading Edge</b> while the <b>Sample Writing</b> is in
          <b>Falling Edge</b> and Vice Versa if CLK_PH=1.
        </li>
      </ul>
