      <h2>I2C Specs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Serial</li>
        <li>Synchronous</li>
        <li>Half-Duplex</li>
        <li>Multi-Master Multi-Slave</li>
      </ul>

      <figure>

        <p>
          As we specified in the properties of I2C that its synch so we do have
          a shared clk and since its half-duplex so there is only one wire for
          sending and recieving the data which we called data-wire .
        </p>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The CLK and Data bus are connected to a pull up resistor which means
        that all the MCs reads a signal of 1 so if a master wanna send a signal
        of 1 to a slave it doesn't need to do anything we call this process
        <b>Floating</b> and we call the 1 signal in that case
        <b>Recessive Bit</b> while the 0 we call it <b>Dominant Bit</b> and that
        is because if one master want to send a 0 the whole bus will change to a
        zero to transfere it. so now lets dive deeper into the hardware and see
        how it actually works and transfers the signal.
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        This internal circuit is called <b>Open drain</b>, Such that if we wanna
        write in the register a 1 the inverter will switch it to 0 and the wire
        will remain floating such that the buss will carry a signal of 1, while
        if we wanna write a signal of 0 the inverter will change it to a 0 and
        will connect the circuit to the ground and the bus line will change into
        a ZERO. <br />
        Side-Note: The Pull up Resistor is 4.7 Kohm

      <h3>Master Process to Write</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Start Bit</b>: 0</li>
        <li><b>Slave Address</b>: 7-bits</li>
        <li><b>Operation</b>: 0 to write / 1 to read</li>
        <li>
          <b>Acknowledge/Not-Acknowledge</b>: Validation to say that the slave
          is ready to recieve data. o to Ack / 1 to NAck
        </li>
        <li><b>Data</b>: 8-bits</li>
        <li><b>Acknowledge/Not-Acknowledge</b></li>
        .....remains on the same process till we wanna stop
        <li>
          Master sends Not-Acknoledge, which is optional we can send a stop
          right away
        </li>
        <li><b>stop</b>: By sending a 1 on the Bus</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <b
          >The Master Is the CLK Source and the Initiator to the Process of
          Communication either write or read and the one that selects the slave

      <h2>SDA BUS</h2>

      <figure>
        <img src="Pics/I2C-SDA.JPG" alt="SDA" />
        <p>
          The Diagram above draws a scenario where we have 3 Masters connected
          to the I2C and we wanna discuss what's been written on the SDA-bus.
        </p>
      </figure>
      <ol>
        <li>All three Masters sent a signal of 1 in the beginning</li>
        <li>The SDA writes a signal of 1</li>
        <li>
          Each Master compares the value written on the SDA to the value he
          wanted to write in the beginning and since they all needed a 1 so they
          all move forward.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the Second CLK High Pulse M1 and M2 wanted to write a 0 while M3
          wanted a 1
        </li>
        <li>Since 0 is the dominant bit, therfore a 0 is written on the SDA</li>
        <li>
          Now each master Compares the SDA written value with his original
          value, where M1 and M2 won't have a problem and will move forward,
          while M3 will deduce that he Lost the <b>ARBITRATION</b>. and will
          stop transmitting.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>So what is an Arbitration!!</h3>
      <p>
        Its the phase where all the masters wanna write their values on the SDA
        bus and the one who always wins is the one with most 0s.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Let's dive deeper into this concept and reflect it on the Frame we
        discussed earlier
      </h4>
      <ol>
        <li>So the Frame said we need to begin with a start of 0</li>
        <li>Then the MCs Sends the 7-bit Address of the slave</li>
        <li>
          Since the MC starts with <b><em>Most segnificant Bit</em></b
          >(from Right to Left), therfore it will start reading the first bit of
          the address.
        </li>
        <li>
          The MC that's gonna win the Arbitration, is the one whom got more
          zeros from the right.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>
        As we know for now that we do have 7 bits reserved for the slave
        addresses, so does that mean we can connect 128 device to the MC!!
      </h4>
      <p>
        The answer is a partial yes, where its true we have 128 different
        addresses, yet not all of them can be used cuz there are some
        <b>RESERVED</b> addresses and those are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Broadcast</b>(000 0000): This is researved cuz it will always take
          the priority and will talk to all slaves
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Reserved Bits</b>(1111 xxx): so 2<sup>3</sup> gives us 8 different
          values.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Therfore we can say that we have a total of 9 reserved addresses out of
        the 128 so we can only connect only 119 slave(device).
      </p>

      <p>
        Let us draw a second scenario were 2 Masters were targeting the same
        addresses so the upcoming bit would be either a 0 to write or a 1 to
        read, therfore by applying the same concept we can conclude that the
        writing got a higher priority.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now a final scenario we can draw were the 2 Masters sent the same
        addresses and wanted to make the same operation now the next bits would
        be the data bits, let us say that they will even send the same data bits
        this scenario is called <b>Win win Operation</b>.
      </p>

      <h2>Clock Stretching</h2>
      <p>
        As we discussed earlier the default handler of the clk is the master yet
        there is a case were the slave is slower than the clk sent and since
        they are both connected to the same SCL and got an open drain circuit so
        the slave can write a 0 on the SCL and if the pulse is low the master
        will wait till the high pulse come to continue its original process this
        concept is called <b>CLK Stretching</b>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Repeated start</h2>
      <p>
        If a Master won an arbitration and successfully sent/recieved data and
        then it sent a stopping signal therfore a new arbitration will formulate
        to see the upcoming data that will be sent, yet what if we instead
        sending a stop we sent a new start, this will allow the MC that won the
        arbitration to continue talking and then it can send the new slave
        address and the operation, as long as a stop was not sent and the Master
        didn't leave the bus no one will ever let him out this can be a double
        sowrded weapon.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Network Starvation</h2>
      <p>
        It means that a Master kept the data line for itself and didn't allow
        any other master to send or recieve data just took the bus for itself
        till all the other slaves and masters starved.
      </p>
      <h3>Causes</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Repeated Start</li>
        <li>CLK Stretching</li>
        <li>Data Endless</li>
      </ol>
